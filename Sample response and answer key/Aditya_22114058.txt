DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule that carries the genetic information in all living organisms.
It consists of a double helix structure made up of nucleotide units. Each nucleotide is composed of a phosphate group, a deoxyribose sugar molecule, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), or guanine (G).
In cells, DNA serves as a blueprint for the synthesis of proteins, which are essential for various biological processes. This process begins with transcription, during which a segment of DNA is copied into a complementary molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA).
DNA replication is another crucial function of DNA, which ensures that each new cell receives an accurate copy of the genetic information during cell division. DNA's ability to store and , genetic information is central to the inheritance and diversity of life on Earth.
